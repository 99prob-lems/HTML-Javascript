   				<p> I count this section as part of my evaluation . Learning Javascript in such a short time proved to be challenging. We were taught the basics during lecture, However in order to for us to be able to implement API's within the web pages in a presentable manner we needed to become used to the Javascript syntax. Using various resources I was able to implement some form of weather system within my web pages.
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
